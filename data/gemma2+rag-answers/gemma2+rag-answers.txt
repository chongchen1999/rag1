Hello, I'm your assistant, how can I help you?

During which period was UNIVAC 1107 developed, and what technological advancement characterized this era?

a) 1937-1946, using vacuum tubes

b) 1947-1962, using transistors

c) 1963-1975, using integrated circuits

d) 1975-present, using microprocessors

The answer is (b) 1947-1962, using transistors.

Here's why:

The text states that the UNIVAC 1107 was an example of a computer from the Second Generation, which spanned from 1947 to 1962. The defining characteristic of the Second Generation was the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes.

Which historical development in 1973 fundamentally changed how computers could be interconnected?

a) The invention of UNIX operating system

b) Development of DRAM by Intel

c) Robert Metcalfe's development of Ethernet

d) The creation of the floppy disk

The answer is (c) Robert Metcalfe's development of Ethernet.

Here's why:

Ethernet is a networking technology that allows computers and other devices to communicate with each other over a shared cable. This was a groundbreaking development in 1973, as it paved the way for local area networks (LANs) and the interconnected world we have today.

What significant advancement occurred in 2016 that marked a breakthrough in quantum computing?

a) The first commercially available quantum computer

b) The first quantum network

c) The first reprogrammable quantum computer

d) The first stable quantum bit

The best answer here is (d) The first stable quantum bit.

Here's why:

While there have been advancements in quantum computing since 2016, the focus at that time was largely on creating more stable qubits. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum computers, and their stability is crucial for reliable computation.

In the context of early computer development, what was the primary motivation for creating ENIAC?

a) Business automation

b) Scientific research

c) Census tabulation

d) Military calculations

The primary motivation for creating ENIAC was (d) Military calculations.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was built during World War II to help with complex calculations related to ballistics and artillery fire.

Which 1977 development represented a significant shift in making computers accessible to non-technical users?

a) The Apple II launch

b) The TRS-80's initial production

c) The invention of VisiCalc

d) The development of WordStar

The answer is (b) The TRS-80's initial production.

Here's why:

The passage states that the TRS-80, with its user-friendly documentation, allowed "non geeks" to write programs and make a computer do what they wished for the first time.

What was the key technological distinction of the Gavilan SC in 1983?

a) It was the first portable computer with a GUI

b) It was the first to use MS-DOS

c) It was the first with a flip form factor marketed as a "laptop"

d) It was the first to use integrated circuits

The answer is (c) It was the first with a flip form factor marketed as a "laptop".

In a Red-Black tree, which property is NOT required for the tree to be valid?

a) Every node is either red or black

b) The root is black

c) All paths from root to NULL have the same number of red nodes

d) All leaves (NULL) are considered black

The answer is (c) All paths from root to NULL have the same number of red nodes.

Here's why:

Red-Black trees are a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. They maintain balance to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Given a distributed system using the Paxos consensus algorithm, what is the minimum number of nodes that must be operational to achieve consensus in a system with N nodes?

a) N/2

b) N/2 + 1

c) 2N/3

d) N - 1

The answer is (b) N/2 + 1.

Here's why:

Paxos Consensus: Paxos is a distributed consensus algorithm used to ensure that all nodes in a system agree on the same value. Quorum Requirement: To achieve consensus, Paxos requires a quorum of nodes. A quorum is a supermajority of nodes â€“ more than half. Minimum Operational Nodes: In a system with N nodes, the minimum number of operational nodes required to form a quorum is (N/2) + 1. This ensures that there's always a majority of nodes available to reach agreement even if some nodes fail.

In the context of CPU cache design, which of the following cache mapping policies would result in the highest hit rate but potentially the most expensive implementation?

a) Direct mapping

b) Set associative mapping

c) Fully associative mapping

d) Sequential mapping

The answer is (c) Fully associative mapping. Here's why:

Fully associative mapping allows any memory block to be placed in any cache location. This means the CPU can always find the most recently accessed data, leading to the highest hit rate. The downside: Fully associative mapping requires complex hardware to search through all cache locations for a match, making it the most expensive to implement.

When implementing a B+ tree index in a database system, what is the optimal fill factor (percentage of space used in each node) to maximize performance?

a) 50%

b) 67%

c) 75%

d) 100%

There isn't a single "optimal" fill factor that works best for all B+ tree implementations. The ideal fill factor depends on several factors, including data size, disk block size, and hardware characteristics. However, common practices suggest that fill factors between 60% and 70% often provide a good balance.
